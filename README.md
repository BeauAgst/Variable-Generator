# To Do

* Remove commented lines
* Remove escaped chars
* 3 dictionaries (classes, properties, variables)
* store class names in a list (which will added to variables_dictionary) as loop through class_dictionary, remove/add as group_count increments
* Check for hooks, prefix to list
* Compare group_count against new nest value, use to check for another nest, or to remove class name from list if nest is closed
* For each incrememnt, also check properties_dictionary for properties with a key after that class, and break when new brace is found
